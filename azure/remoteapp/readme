## How can Azure Automation help manage Azure RemoteApp?
RemoteApp can be managed in Azure Automation by using the PowerShell cmdlets that are available in the Azure PowerShell tools. 
Azure Automation has these RemoteApp PowerShell cmdlets available out of the box, so that you can perform all of your RemoteApp management tasks within the service. 
You can also pair these cmdlets in Azure Automation with the cmdlets for other Azure services, to automate complex tasks across Azure services and 3rd party systems.
